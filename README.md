# Programming Languages.

## About the Project
This project provides basic examples of many programming languages and briefly covers major topics for beginners. These examples are made to help beginners understand and see samples of the programming language they are trying to learn.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this little "hobby project", either file a issue report (if there's a syntax mistake for example) or do a pull request to provide a new code. NOTE: view the C folder to see a good example. Not only should all the code for a specific programming language be in its respective folder (i.e. C, Python, etc.), but also the topics you want to cover should be their own labeled folder (like chapters of a textbook).

## Roadmap
View the code within the C folder. Add code examples for the other programming languages that follow the structure of the C folder. 

## Getting Started
To actually make a contribution, follow the README of this repo: 
https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

Anything with carrots (i.e. <>) should be replaced by actual text. For example: <your-branch-name> could be print-statements-in-c.

Essentially, you'll want to:
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo
    - git clone <https-link-here>
3. Create a branch
    - cd Programming_Languages
    - git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
4. Make your necessary changes
    - Add a topic folder under the specific langauge
        - ex: "1 - Usage of Variables and Printf"
    - Add files with the actual code under the correct parent file
        - ex: "example2.c"
5. Add changes to branch
    - git add -A
6. Commit changes to branch 
    - git commit -m "commit message here"
7. Push changes to github
    - git push origin <your-branch-name>
8. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a "Compare & pull" request button. Click on that button.
9. Now submit the pull request (PR).
10. If I accept your PR, then it will now be in the code, otherwise I will leave comments on how to improve your PR.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
-Do NOT submit PRs with folders containing compiled binaries/.o files

-You can only share source code files/folders, along side with the compilation method (in case of C/C++ make or cmake is preferred, or a simple script file to compile with gcc/g++ commands).

-You are not forced to follow a indentation style, just make sure the code is properly readable.
